# Term Deposit Marketing

Introduction:
Building a Machine Learning Model that could predict which factor from the given information of the customers will improve the success rate of the calls for Finance and Banking field.



Data Description:
The Dataset has 13 Columns in addition of the Target Column (Y), the idea is to identify and predict about which given factor from the Customers information out of these Columns will encourge them to buy for the Term Deposit in the Bank.



Methodology:
1. Applying EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) techniques to understand the structure and the content of the dataset and analyze its nature and the required processing steps.
2. Applying Feature Engineering techniques including Feature Encoding, and Feature Scaling.
3. Applying Correlation Coefficient technique to analyze and understand the relationship between dataset factors with thier closeness to the Targeted answer (Y).
4. Labeling the dataset to make the columns with their same original order before the processing. 
5. Splitting the dataset into 80% for training set and 20% for testing set.
6. Building and Training the model using SVM algorithm.
7. Training the model further while applying K-Fold Cross-Validation technique using 5 folds.


Conclusion:
The result reached to 92.4% of Accuracy using SVM algorithm, and 92.8% of Accuracy while applying K-Fold Cross-Validation.
